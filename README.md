## Work distribution

Following TODO correpond to first deliverable


 - For sentence encoding/matching part
 - [x] Locally working example (for pretrained infersent) where vocab and model checkpoint can be downloaded
 - [ ] Streamlit share working example (for pretrained infersent and five tweets scoring) where vocab and model checkpoint can be downloaded
 - [ ] From scoring to a matching problem
 - [ ] Simple user interface: click on one tweet, select top_n, cosine or nli score (future), etc
 - [ ] Training scripts for fine tuning infersent 
   - Finished training scripts (needs formatting)
   - Need to find ways to transform load_weights method since it is different from the pretrained case (may not in this submission)
   - Replace pretraining code to loading fine-tuned models code

## Deliverables

### Proposal

- [ ] The URL at the top of this readme needs to point to your application online. It should also list the names of the team members.
- [ ] A completed proposal. The contact should submit it as a PDF on Canvas.

### Design review

### Final deliverables

- [ ] All code for the project should be in the repo.
- [ ] A 5 minute video demonstration.
- [ ] Update Readme according to Canvas instructions.
