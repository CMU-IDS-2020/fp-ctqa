A commentary on the project process: the project begins in brainstorming ideas with sufficient depth and appropriate scope. Then dataset exploration, dataset comparision, data cleaning, data sampling, and data preprocessing operations are performned parallelly with the development of the two models. All team members contributes to the bringing up ideas on different strategies on offline training to reduce workload for the streamlit server. Also, the team tries to make informed decision at every section of the project especially in selecting hyperparamters for users to interact with.
